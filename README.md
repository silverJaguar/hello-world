# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I'm silverJaguar, but you probably know that already. After all, it says it right there! 

I have a lot of hobbies. I love to play violin and knit, but if I can, you will usually find me with a book in my hands or a coding tutorial video in front of my eyes. I don't like big crowds; they make me dizzy. But I still enjoy the company of my friends and family!
